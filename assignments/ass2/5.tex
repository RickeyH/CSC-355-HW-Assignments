\section{Question 5}

\subsection{Part a}

\begin{question}
    Implement the bisection method as a function in $\MATLAB$ taking the form
    \begin{verbatim}
	function [p,iters] = bisectionmethod(f,a,b)
	\end{verbatim}
	with \verb+f+ the function, \verb+a+ and \verb+b+ the starting interval, and \verb+p+ the solution with number of iterations \verb+iters+. Use a tolerance of $10^{-10}$ and stop the algorithm after 100 iterations if it hasn't converged. Include comments describing inputs and outputs.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    
\end{answer}

\subsection{Part b}

\begin{question}
    Use your implementation to solve $f(x) = 0$ for $$f(x) = (x+2)(x+1)^2x(x-1)^3(x-2)$$ given the intervals $[-3,-0.5]$ and $[-0.5,2.4]$. Notice which zero it converges to for each case, and discuss the convergence rate. (Give tables of the form \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} $a$ & $b$ & $p$ & $f(p)$ \\ \hline &&& \end{tabular} to help your discussion)
\end{question}
