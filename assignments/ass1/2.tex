\section{Question 2}

\begin{question}
    For $f(x) = e^x \sin{(x)}$
\end{question}

\subsection{Part (a)}

\begin{question}
    Determine the third-order Taylor series and the fourth-order Taylor series of $f(x)$ at $x_0 = 0$.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    
\end{answer}

\subsection{Part (b)}

\begin{question}
    Approximate $f(.1)$ to five digits with both series from part (a). Give both error terms.
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    
\end{answer}

\subsection{Part (c)}

\begin{question}
   Give upper bounds for both approximations to seven digits. Which approximation is better to use for $f(.1)$?
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    
\end{answer}

\subsection{Part (d)}

\begin{question}
   (Bonus: no points off for wrong answers) Why do you think the approximation you chose is better? If you chose based on error bounds, what makes that approximation have less error?
\end{question}
