\section{Question 2}

\begin{question}
    In \MATLAB, use your implementation of steepest descent to minimize the distance from the plane $x+2y+3z=10$ to the point $(1,1,1)$. Use an initial guess of \verb+[1; 1]+, a tolerance of $10^{-10}$, and a reasonable max number of iterations (use your best judgement!) Report the final solution, and give your iteration output info (iteration number, function value, and step size).
\end{question}
