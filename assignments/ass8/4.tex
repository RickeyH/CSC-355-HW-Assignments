\section{Question 4}

\begin{question}
    (5 bonus pts for making a good effort on this problem): A biological experiment determines the maximum water temperature at which various species of hydra can survive without shortened life expectancy. One approach uses a weighted least squares fit of the form $f(x) = y = \frac{a}{(x-b)^c}$ to a collection of experimental data. Minimize the residual in the fit given by the equation $$r(a,b,c) = \sum_{i=1}^n \left( y_i\ln y_i - \frac{a}{(x_i-b)^c} \right)^2$$ given the data 
        \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}
            $i$ & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\ \hline $x_i$ & 31.8 & 31.5 & 31.2 & 30.2 \\ $y_i$ & 2.4 & 3.8 & 4.75 & 21.6
        \end{tabular}
    Use your implementation of the steepest descent method in \MATLAB with a tolerance of $10^{-2}$ and enough iterations to converge. Report the final solution, and all iteration output info.
