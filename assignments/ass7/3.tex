\section{Question 3}

\begin{question}
    Implement the Shamanskii method for nonlinear systems in \MATLAB in a function of the form \verb+function p = sham_sys(F,J,p0,tol,maxiter)+. Start with a Newton step. Test it on both F and G. How do the final solutions and number of iterations compare to Newtonâ€™s method?
