\section{Question 2}

\begin{question}
    Use Newton’s method in \MATLAB for nonlinear systems to solve the system in (1) with an initial guess of \verb+[.1;.1;-.1]+ Use a tolerance of $10^{−10}$ and $50$ as the max number of iterations. Report the final solution and how many iterations it took to reach it. Compare the number of iterations to the example we ran in class $G(x) = \left[\begin{smallmatrix}3x_1 − cos(x_2x_3) − 0.5 = 0\\  {x_1}^2 −  625{x_2}^2 − 0.25 = 0\\ e^{−x_1x_2} + 20x_3 + \tfrac{10\pi−3}{3}  = 0\end{smallmatrix}\right]$ with the same initial guess. What is the reason for the difference? (besides the second equation being different - think about what changing the second equation does)
