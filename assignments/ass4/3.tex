\section{Question 3}

\begin{question}
    Derive the general system of equations that can be solved to obtain a cubic spline made up of $n$ cubic polynomials $S_j(x) = a_j+b_j(x-x_j)+c_j(x-x_j)^2+d_j(x-x_j)^3$ for a given function $f$ over an interval divided into $n$ subintervals by the points $x_0, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$. Use the not-a-knot boundary conditions.
    
    (not-a-knot condition: ${s_0}^{'''}(x_1) = {s_1}^{'''}(x_1)$; ${s_n}^{'''}(x_{n-1}) = {s_{n-1}}^{'''}(x_{n-1})$)
