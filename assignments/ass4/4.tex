\section{Question 4}

\begin{question}
    Use Matlab's \verb+csape+ function from the Curve Fitting Toolbox with the end condition \verb+`variational'+ to interpolate the function $f(x) = 2\cos x$ on $[0,2\pi]$ in $n=5$ even subintervals with a natural cubic spline. Interpolate the same data with the \verb+`not-a-knot'+ end condition (or the \verb+spline+ function) and compare the results.
\end{question}

\subsection{Part a}

\begin{question}
    Plot both interpolating polynomials and $f(x)$ on the same plot over $[0,2\pi]$. You'll need to use \verb+fnplt+ to plot the result of \verb+csape+
\end{question}

\begin{answer}
    
\end{answer}

\subsection{Part b}

\begin{question}
    Which approximation is better? Why is the one you chose better? Discuss in a few sentences, and mention where the approximations are different, and what about $f(x)$ makes them different there.
\end{question}
