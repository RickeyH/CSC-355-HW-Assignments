\section{Question 2}

\begin{question}
    Implement a function in Matlab that approximates an integral using composite Simpson’s rule. Your function should take the form function
    
    \verb+S = comp_simp(fvals,h)+ 
    
    which takes a vector of function values and step size \verb+h+ , and outputs the value of the integral. Test your function on an integral that composite Simpson’s evaluates exactly. Include the code for your function and test script as well as the output for the test script in your answer.
