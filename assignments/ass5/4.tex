\section{Question 4}

\begin{question}
    Use Newton’s method with $p0 = 0.6$ to generate one approximate solution $p1$ to $f(x) = 0$ for $f(x) = \int_{0}^{x}{\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{t^2}{2}}}\,dt - 0.45$, given that $f'(x) = \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{x^2}{2}}$. Use composite Simpson’s rule with $n = 6$ to approximate the integral involved. You can compute this by hand or by using your \MATLAB functions for Newton and composite Simpson rule.
